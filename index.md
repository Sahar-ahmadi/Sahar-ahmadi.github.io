I am a Ph.D. student in the Preservation of Architectural Heritage program at the Department of Architecture and Urban Studies (DASTU) at Politecnico di Milano.
My main research interests lie in the fields of conservation and management of monuments and sites, materials analysis, and decay mapping. After doing my MSc thesis on the management of the archaeological site of Khorheh (Iran), I was awarded the Raymond Lemaire Fund scholarship by ICOMOS International.
My Ph.D. research is focused on the rock-cut architectural heritage of Iran, with a specific focus on Naqshe-Rustam historical site dating back to the first millennium BC. The study consists of different aspects, including analysis of historical records and material laboratory analysis. For this reason, I spent a part of my studies in the site for data collection and documentation of the site in collaboration with the Persepolis -and- Pasargadae World Heritage Foundation. Currently, I am working with the Institute of Heritage Science (ISPC) Italian National Research Council (CNR) laboratory on studying the materials and reasons for decays. Meanwhile, I am analyzing the content of European travelogues since the 17th century in order to develop a timeline of evolutions in the site and its surrounding territory in order to put the current conservation problems of the monuments in an inclusive historical and environmental framework.
