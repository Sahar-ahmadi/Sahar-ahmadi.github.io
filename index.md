I am a Ph.D. student in the Preservation of Architectural Heritage program at the Department of Architecture and Urban Studies (DASTU) at Politecnico di Milano. This is a web page dedicated to the results of the activities which I accomplished during the workshop "Humanities Data and Mapping Environment." The workshop was focused on the mapping method in studying digital humanities. Since my research include the study of medieval and modern archive about heritage sites in Iran with a specific focus on rock-cut architecture tree example of maps which could cover a different aspect of relevant data are presented in this Github webpage. First, there are geocoding archeological sites in Umapt. The second map page contains a Story map for Iranian rock-cut architecture in the Zagros mountains. The third Interactive map with photos of Iranian world heritage sites.
